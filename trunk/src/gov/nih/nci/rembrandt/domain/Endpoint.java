/**
 * A primary or secondary outcome that can be measured objectively to determine whether or not an intervention under study
 * is beneficial. The endpoints of a clinical trial are usually included in the study objectives. Some examples of
 * endpoints are survival, improvements in quality of life, relief of symptoms, and disappearance of the tumor.
 * 
 * BRIDG: An outcome variable of interest in the study. An outcome is a change in subject status established by comparing
 * two or more observations on that status as a result of a study-defined intervention (paraphrase of Peter Shaughnessy).
 * The values that are assessed to meet or not meet endpoints are data gathered as a result of study events.
